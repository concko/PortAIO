### - Frequently Asked Questions :
1. What is a port? : A port is code used from another script from a completely different scripting platform and making it compatible with EloBuddy.

2. Does PortAIO support all the champions? : Yes we do! We support all 131 (as of 6.13) champions in LoL.

3. Will PortAIO ever have BoL scripts? : As of now no, converting code from LUA to C# is fairly difficult but its currently not any where on our agenda.

4. Why was this project started? : I had the idea of PortAIO back when there wasn't much developers on EB and I wanted to kick-start the community so I thought of this insanely time-consuming project and just made it happen, also to appeal to the users that want to use L# but don't want to invest in it.

5. What is a dual-port? : The dual-port feature allows for you to change the port you are using for your champion/utility, as of 6.13 patch the dual-port feature does not support every champion/utility. For example if you're playing Vayne the default Vayne port is ChallengerVayne, if for some reason there is a problem or you just don't like ChallengerVayne, you can open PortAIO Misc in the menu and change to another Vayne port, you can do the same with utilities.

6. Why is PortAIO not on EB? : Roughly 3-ish months ago when I had the idea of this project ported addons were allowed on the forums, as development progressed PortAIO was becoming a bit of a topic on the forums, the mods/admins came to notify me that AIOs were not allowed but I was hoping they'd make an exception for this massive project, they didn't. Soon afterwards, they completely banned ported work unless you had permission and until this day it still is, I've been fighting to get the rule removed but no luck. RIP.
